kradfile-u.txt is a hanzi ("kanji") to radical mapping obtainable from http://ftp.usf.edu/pub/ftp.monash.edu.au/pub/nihongo/ (among other useful files)
radical_meanings.txt is borrowed from https://github.com/nieldlr/hanzi/blob/master/lib/data/radicalListWithMeaning.js
routledge_*.txt are each from their respective Routledge frequency dictionaries. I like these frequency dictionaries because they are recent and the method is explained well.
